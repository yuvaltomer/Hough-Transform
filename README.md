# Hough-Transform
This python program suggests a simple implementation to the Hough transform algorithm, used to detect straight lines in source images.
Detailed information and research about Hough transform can be found in Hough_Transform_Final_Paper.pdf (Hebrew) or online at https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2022/06/a-complete-guide-on-hough-transform/

## Prerequisites:
Make sure you have Python3 and OpenCV (cv2) installed before using this program.

### Note:
Note that some parameters, defined as constant variables, should be modified in order for the program to work as expected with different types of inputs. Please read the documentation of the relevant functions to avoid invalid inputs and exceptions before changing the values of these variables.
  
I hope you can find this program and its source code helpful!
